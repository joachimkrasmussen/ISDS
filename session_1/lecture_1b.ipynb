    "    - *Social Media*: Facebook status updates, public 'tweeting', Instagram pictures, etc.\n",
    "    - *Shopping*: Online shopping (track everything, make experiments), in store shopping (memberships, less granular data).\n",
    "    - *Phones*: Patterns in phone calls, GPS logging, phone activity (see recent SODAS studies), etc.\n",
    "- Faster and bigger **computers** ([Waldrop, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26863965/)):\n",
    "    - Moore’s law $\\sim$ transistors on a microprocessor chip doubles every two years \n",
